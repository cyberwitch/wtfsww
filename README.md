What the Fuck Should We Watch is a webapp for deciding what to watch with friends.  When you and your friends sign
up, the app allows you to keep track of what movies and TV shows you hear good things about and want to check out.
When you're hanging out with your friends, you simply pull out the app, drop your friends on the couch, and the app
tells you what you all want to watch, as well as where (streaming services/movie theatres) to watch it!

This is the python backend to the web service.
